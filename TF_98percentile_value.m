%This script is used to open multiple TF data plots and determine the 98th
%percentile value for each map

%This was specifically used in JMM et al. 2020 to compare the effect of
%shCDH1 KD on traction forces. We quantify the 98th percentile value in
%control and KD colonies to measure how reduction of CDH1 abrogates the
%ability to generate high traction stresses. The output is a vector where
%each value corresponds to the Pa measurement of the 98th percentile for
%the corresponding map

files = dir('*.txt');

output = zeros(numfiles,1);
%if plotting, need to have inferno colormap function in matlab path

%If masking, need to already have a varialbe 'mask' defined so that the text file
%doesn't have to be in the same folder. See the next two lines of annotated
%code for how to do this for a file named 'Mask_sq_border3.txt' that is 126x126

%this mask removes values at a depth of 3 pixels from the edge of the map,
%corresponding to artifacts that typically occur at the edges
