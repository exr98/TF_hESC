%This script is used to open multiple TF data plots and determine number of
%pixels in the plot greater than a certain value

%This was specifically used in JMM et al. 2020 to compare the effect of
%shCDH1 KD on traction forces. Using the avg map of TF for shCDH1 control,
%we determined the 98 percentile of TF values = 21 Pa, and confirmed that
%thresholding at this value appropriately masks the corners. Thus, we used
%this program to iterate through all control and KD maps and determine the
%number of pixels, later converted to area, that demonstrate greater than
%21 Pa stresses

%count and import files
files = dir('*.txt');
numfiles = length(files);
output = zeros(numfiles,1);

%If masking, need to already have a varialbe 'mask' defined so that the text file
%doesn't have to be in the same folder. See the next two lines of annotated
%code for how to do this for a file named 'mask_sq.txt' that is 126x126
%pixels
